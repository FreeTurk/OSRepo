An easy script for you to find the desired image file for the OS of your choice.

This has started as an ambitious project, all about me trying to make some people's lives easier.

This script is pretty easy, it explains itself. You just have to follow the procedure it provides.

If you find any mistake, just start an issue on the GitHub repo. I'm new to coding, and this is not an easy project by any means.

For legal reasons and storage constraints, this script only auto-opens the URL that are already provided by the OS owners (except stuff like macOS where I obviously have to use some Hackintosh image instead of the original one)

There should be a Patreon link around here somewhere if this ever blows up to be successful. If it did not, no coffee for me.

-[x] Done sample code to work on.
-[ ] Added a big library of OSs.
-[ ] Polished README.md
-[ ] Lifelessly copy and paste repo links of different OSs.
-[ ] Find obscure OSs for weird people.
