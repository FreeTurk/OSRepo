# OSRepo - the stable version 
# NOW FEATURING A GUI


this is the backend for the next great thing for OSR: The first stable release. In this branch we have made new changes:

* gotten rid of (some) wip areas (and hopefully added them to the repo)

* added new OSes (currently 100+ OSes)
  * some really weird ones if you are very much mentally unstable
  * more linux distros
  * red hat

* for Windows users: a new installer! Now you can install OSR using a proper installer without having to open, move, copy files or whatever! its just easy.

* performance improvements

* completely re-coded the backend in python using computer magic (there are many more options and more usability in this version, i promise)
  * computer magic also helps features like OS search, user files, and a generally better experience!

* also now the user can get live updates of the repo. No need to update OSR to get new updates. The program gets the latest version of the repo everytime it is launched so you don't miss out on cool new OSes freshly added to the repo

* added support for user files: .osrepo files written in YAML format can be imported. (maybe  available on future versions?)
 * now you can find the user.yaml file to see a brief example file to see how to write an .osrepo file (in yaml syntax)!

* ...and yes, auto-update.

* backend almost complete! Maybe a GUI coming?? PyQT????

* *Thanks baris-inandi for the support, you a real bro.
