# OSRepo - the stable version


this is the backend for the next great thing for OSR: The first stable release. In this branch i have:

* gotten rid of wip areas (and hopefully added them to the repo)

* added new OSes (there are almost a hundred OSes now in the repo in total)

* completely re-coded the backend in python using computer magic (there are many more options and more usability in this version, i promise)

* also now the user can get live updates of the repo. No need to update OSR to get new updates. The program gets the latest version of the repo everytime it is launched.

* added support for user files: .osrepo files written in YAML format can be imported.
